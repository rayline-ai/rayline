"""Use Rayline's hosted cloud router from Python via the Anthropic SDK.

This points the official `anthropic` client at the hosted Rayline router instead
of api.anthropic.com. The router decides where each request goes and forwards it
on with your provider credentials.

Prerequisites:
  1. pip install -r requirements.txt
  2. Generate a router key at https://platform.rayline.ai/keys. It looks like
     "rlk-...". Either export it as RAYLINE_API_KEY or paste it into API_KEY
     below.

Run:
  python main.py
"""
