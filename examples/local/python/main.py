"""Route an Anthropic SDK call to your on-device model via Rayline (Python).

Traffic flows through Rayline's local proxy on 127.0.0.1:20810 to the on-device
router (rld), which routes by your config — no special headers needed. The
default local config maps the model name "rayline-local" to your on-device
endpoint, so requesting that model lands the call on your local model.

Start the router with `rayline router start` (no Claude session needed). It
defaults to routing every request through the router, so a plain call requesting
model "rayline-local" reaches the on-device model.

Caveat: a raw API call only gets the model, not Claude Code's agent harness, so
the on-device model has no file tools — it answers prompts, it doesn't browse
files.

Prerequisites:
  1. pip install -r requirements.txt
  2. A running router with a local model loaded (give it a minute to load on
     first use):
         rayline router start
     Confirm it is up:
         curl -s http://127.0.0.1:20810/healthz   # expect "local_available": true
     Stop it later with: rayline router stop
  3. Because Rayline intercepts TLS, set CA_CERT to the proxy CA path for your OS:
         macOS:   ~/Library/Application Support/rayline/proxy-ca.pem
         Linux:   ~/.config/rayline/proxy-ca.pem
         Windows: %APPDATA%\\rayline\\proxy-ca.pem

Run:
  python main.py
