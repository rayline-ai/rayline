/**
 * Route an Anthropic SDK call to your on-device model via Rayline (TypeScript).
 *
 * Traffic flows through Rayline's local proxy on 127.0.0.1:20810 to the on-device
 * router (rld), which routes by your config — no special headers needed. The
 * default local config maps the model name "rayline-local" to your on-device
 * endpoint, so requesting that model lands the call on your local model.
 *
 * Start the router with `rayline router start` (no Claude session needed). It
 * defaults to routing every request through the router, so a plain call
 * requesting model "rayline-local" reaches the on-device model.
 *
 * Caveat: a raw API call only gets the model, not Claude Code's agent harness,
 * so the on-device model has no file tools — it answers prompts, it doesn't
 * browse files.
 *
 * Prerequisites:
 *   1. npm install
 *   2. Node 18+ (uses the built-in fetch + undici dispatcher).
 *   3. A running router with a local model loaded (give it a minute to load on
 *      first use):
 *          rayline router start
 *      Confirm it is up:
 *          curl -s http://127.0.0.1:20810/healthz   # expect "local_available": true
 *      Stop it later with: rayline router stop
 *   4. Because Rayline intercepts TLS, set CA_PATH to the proxy CA path for your
 *      OS:
 *          macOS:   ~/Library/Application Support/rayline/proxy-ca.pem
 *          Linux:   ~/.config/rayline/proxy-ca.pem
 *          Windows: %APPDATA%\rayline\proxy-ca.pem
 *
 * Run:
 *   npx tsx main.ts
